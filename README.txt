## Project structure
* Don't modify anything outside /app
* Every html, css and js file goes into their corresponding directory inside /client
* Every route goes into the router.js inside /both/router.js


## How to run
There are two ways to run the meteor app:
* if your system supports bash commands (Window doesn't support natively), inside Algowoods directory, just type "bash start"
* if your system doesn't, then "cd app", and run "meteor run" inside app directory
